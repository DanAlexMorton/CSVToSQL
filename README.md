# CSVToSQL

Please Read this before you continue!

This is not a finished or working product.
I initially done the Converter.cs code in C# form you can find this in the CSVUploader (https://github.com/DanAlexMorton/CSVUploader) Repository.

I then a dontnet react project with authentication using the Reverse Engineering Sacafolding techinque to link up a SQL Server db with one table on mylocal host. 

I did not have time to finish this.
